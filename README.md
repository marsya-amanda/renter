# Renter — Peer-to-Peer Rental Marketplace (Proof-of-Concept)

> A proof-of-concept marketplace where users can list and rent items from each other — collaboratively built as a full-stack web application for SYNCSHACK 2025.

Renter is an experimental full-stack marketplace that supports user-driven item rentals. Users can create listings, browse items, and rent from other users. The project was developed to explore the role digital tools would play 'in cities of the future' (which was the theme of the hack!)

## 🔧 What Renter Is (Now)

- A working prototype where users can sign in, list items for rent, browse available rentals, and rent those items.  
- A clean separation between **frontend** (UI, user flows) and **backend services**, demonstrating end-to-end web app development.  
- Layout design for listing pages, item views, and user flows — enough for a functional, user-facing interface.  
- A foundation that can be extended into a fully-fledged marketplace (with payment, reviews, search, etc).

## 🛠️ Technical Challenges & What I Learned

This project exposed me to common challenges in **building a full-stack web applicationg and working in a team**:

- **State management & user flows:** Handling user sessions, listing creation, and item browsing.  
- **Frontend-backend interface design:** Ensuring data flows smoothly from backend storage to frontend listing displays and interactions.  
- **Designing for extensibility:** Even though it’s a prototype, the structure allows for future features: payment, reviews, search & filtering, etc.
